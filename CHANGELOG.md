3.0.0-RC1

* The library is now split into 3 separate modules. Core, Rationales, and Coroutines.
* Coroutines support! No callbacks.
* Upgrade dependencies and project structure.
* Add `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` to the `Permission` enum.
* Got rid of Timber for logging (doesn't really make sense for a library). Log to the logcat directly.
